# tree-sitter-roto

A [tree-sitter] grammar for the [Roto programming language][Roto].

## Usage

Tree-sitter grammars can be used for syntax highlighting and other features in
many editors, such as Helix, Neovim and Zed. The instructions for that can be
found in the documentation of your editor of choice. You might need a
`highlights.scm` file to get syntax highlighting to work. This file is located
the `queries` folder.

You can work with this grammar using the tree-sitter CLI to test the grammar or
highlight single files.
